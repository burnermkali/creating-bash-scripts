# creating-bash-scripts

Create a new file with the '.sh' extension
Use the '#!' notation at the top of the file, also known as the shebang, to indicate which interpreter to use
Include comments throughout the script to describe its purpose and make it easy to understand for others
Utilize variables to store values that may change or need to be reused multiple times
Use the echo command to print out the values of variables or other information to the console
Gather information about the system's network configuration using the ifconfig command
Create an alias, a shortcut for a command or set of commands, for frequently used commands
Reference the value of a variable or command output in the script using the $ notation
Implement conditional statements such as 'if-else' to perform different actions based on the outcome of a comparison or test
Continuously test the script and ensure it is functioning as intended.

By following these steps, you can write effective bash scripts for automating tasks on Linux systems and streamline your workflow.
